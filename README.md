# Montage_System
In this project, we can generate detailed and fragmented car parts, industrial materials through code, either randomly positioned or on the ground. Later, we can accurately drag them to assemble. Parts requiring rotation, like screws, are marked and assembled by rotating. We're also able to disassemble the parts.
